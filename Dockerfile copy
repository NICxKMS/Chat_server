# Use an official Node.js LTS version (e.g., Node 20)
FROM node:20-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# --- Firebase Credentials Setup ---
# Add an environment variable for Firebase credentials path
ENV GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/firebase/authkey.json

# Make sure the directory exists
RUN mkdir -p /secrets/firebase

# --- Dependency Installation ---
# Copy package files first for better caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install ALL dependencies (including devDependencies needed for the build)
RUN npm ci

# --- Application Code ---
# Copy source code and pre-compiled binary
COPY src ./src
COPY main.exe ./main.exe

# --- Build Step ---
# Run the build script defined in package.json (which needs devDependencies like @babel/cli)
RUN npm run build

# --- Permissions ---
# Make the Go binary executable
RUN chmod +x ./main.exe

# --- Runtime Configuration ---
# Inform Docker that the container listens on port 8080 (standard for Cloud Run)
# Ensure your Node.js (Fastify) app listens on the PORT environment variable (e.g., process.env.PORT || 8080)
EXPOSE 8080

# --- Startup Command ---
# Run both the Node.js server (from the build output) and the Go binary concurrently.
# IMPORTANT: Ensure main.exe is configured to listen on a DIFFERENT port than the Node.js app (e.g., 8090).
# The Node.js app (dist/server.js) should listen on the port specified by the PORT env var (default 8080).
